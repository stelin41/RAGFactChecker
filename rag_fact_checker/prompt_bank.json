Follow these requirements:\n\t1.\tFull Context in Subjects and Objects:\nEach subject and object must include sufficient context so they can stand alone without needing to refer back to the original text. Avoid vague references, pronouns, or terms like ‘changes’ without specifying what changes they refer to. For example, instead of [\"changes\", \"are\", \"transient\"] use something like [\"the changes in thyroid hormone metabolism induced by strenuous physical activity\", \"are\", \"transient and minor\"].\n\t2.\tAccurate Representation of Information:\nCapture the main factual statements or logical relationships from the input text. If the text states that T3 reduces diastolic calcium levels, the triplet should clearly reflect that relationship.\n\t3.\tGrammatical and Logical Consistency:\nEnsure correct grammar and logical consistency in the triplets so that each one can be understood independently. The predicate should accurately connect the subject and object, and maintain the meaning given in the input text.\n\t4.\tNo Additional Explanation or Formatting:\nOnly output the resulting triplets.
